Creative portfolio is a clean and elegant template mainly made for designers and creatives but can be easily transformed into a generic website.

This Hugo theme was ported from [Bootstrapious](https://bootstrapious.com/p/creative-portfolio) for training and fun. It has a very nice landing page, a comments system by Disqus, contact forms by Formspree and Google Analytics.

## Installation

### Use theme component locally as git clone

Go to the directory where you have your Hugo site and run:

```bash
mkdir themes
cd themes
git clone https://github.com/kishaningithub/hugo-creative-portfolio-theme.git
rm -rf hugo-creative-portfolio-theme/.git
```

For more information read the official documentation on [theme components](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/theme-components/).

### Use theme as hugo module

In the root directory of your project, initialise your project as hugo module and add the `hugo-creative-portfolio-theme` theme as dependency:

```bash
hugo mod init github.com/me/my-new-site
hugo mod get github.com/kishaningithub/hugo-creative-portfolio-theme
```

In your `hugo.toml` / `config.toml`, add these lines to add the theme:

```bash
[module]
[[module.imports]]
path = "github.com/google/docsy/dependencies"
```

For more information read the official documentation on [hugo modules](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/use-modules/) of Hugo.

## Configuration

After installing the Creative portfolio theme successfully, i recommend you to take a look at the [exampleSite](https://github.com/kishaningithub/hugo-creative-portfolio-theme/tree/master/exampleSite) directory. You will find a working Hugo site configured with the Creative portfolio theme that you can use as a starting point for your site.

First, let's take a look at the [config.toml](https://github.com/kishaningithub/hugo-creative-portfolio-theme/tree/master/exampleSite/config.toml). It will be useful to learn how to customize your site. Feel free to play around with the settings.

### Style

You can change the color of the theme by modifying the following key.

```toml
style = "default"
```

Available options are: `default` (pink), `blue`, `green`, `pink`, `red`, `sea`, `violet`.

### More style customizations?

Create `css/custom.css` in your `<<base dir>>/static` folder and add all your custom styling.

### Comments

The optional comments system is powered by [Disqus](https://disqus.com). If you want to enable comments, create an account in Disqus and write down your shortname.

```toml
disqusShortname = "your-disqus-short-name"
```

You can disable the comments system by leaving the `disqusShortname` empty.

### Google Analytics

You can optionally enable Google Analytics. Type your tracking code in the ``.

```toml
googleAnalytics = "UA-XXXXX-X"
```

Leave the `googleAnalytics` key empty to disable it.

### Make the contact form working

Since this page will be static, you can use [formspree.io](//formspree.io/) as proxy to send the actual email. Each month, visitors can send you up to one thousand emails without incurring extra charges. Begin the setup by following the steps below:

1. Enter your email address under 'email' in the [`config.toml`](https://github.com/kishaningithub/hugo-creative-portfolio-theme/tree/master/exampleSite/config.toml)
2. Upload the generated site to your server
3. Send a dummy email yourself to confirm your account
4. Click the confirm link in the email from [formspree.io](//formspree.io/)
5. You're done. Happy mailing!

### Nearly finished

In order to see your site in action, run Hugo's built-in local server.

```bash
hugo server
```

Now enter [`localhost:1313`](http://localhost:1313) in the address bar of your browser.
